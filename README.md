# Credit-Card-Approvals
Demonstrated expertise in data manipulation and analysis using Python and a suite of libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Employed Scikit-Learn to implement and fine-tune various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and factors influencing credit card approval comprehensively
Using Sklearn-based machine learning models with a 90% accuracy rate at predicting credit card approval outcomes based on an applicantâ€™s background

## In progress: 
- Making a dashboard to display the findings interactively and elegantly for a better understanding
