# Credit-Card-Approvals
Using machine learning, I predicted whether someone would get their credit card approved, with data obtained from publicly sourced online database, Kaggle
Using machine learning, I predicted whether someone would get their credit card approved. I used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn, and had to apply data cleaning and analysis and machine learning skills.
I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the dataset downloaded from an online databank, addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity. 
Utilizing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques from Sklearn, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify patterns and factors influencing credit card approval and successfully built a predictive model achieving an impressive 90% accuracy rate.
