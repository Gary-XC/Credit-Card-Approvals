# Credit-Card-Approvals
I demonstrated expertise in data manipulation and analysis using Python and a suite of libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

Employed Scikit-Learn to implement and fine-tune various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and factors influencing credit card approval comprehensively 

Using Sklearn-based machine learning models with a 90% accuracy rate at predicting credit card approval outcomes based on an applicant’s background 

## In progress: 
- Making a dashboard to display the findings interactively and elegantly for a better understanding for non-tech literate people
- Separating the data analysis, visualization, and the different models, before providing better comments and reasons as to why columns were included and excluded
